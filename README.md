# TOONDER 📱✨
**Find your next reading "match".**
TOONDER is an application designed to solve the difficulty of finding specific webtoons through a system of **smart combinable hashtags**. The project aims to eliminate the saturation of generic options and connect readers with the stories they truly love.

## 🚀 The Problem we Solve
Many readers feel overwhelmed by automatic recommendations or inefficient search engines that do not allow filtering by specific themes. TOONDER allows combining tags for precise results (e.g., #romance + #vampires + #tragedy). It is the reader who searches specifically for what they feel like reading.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (MVP)
* **Frontend:** React Native + Expo (Cross-platform approach for mobile, tablet, and web).
* **Backend & DB:** Firebase Firestore (NoSQL database for agile tag searching).
* **Autenticación:** Firebase Auth (For profile and favorites management).
